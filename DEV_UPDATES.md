## [March 16, 2026] - Payment Plan Types, Fee Transparency & Cart Recovery Deep Links | Core Feature | High

**Category:** Core Feature
**Impact:** High — Addresses 3 Stage 3 items (3.2, 3.4) bringing payment plans to full spec and closing the cart recovery loop

**Description:**
Three Stage 3 features implemented: the full payment plan model per the build spec (3 installment plan types replacing bi-weekly/monthly), fee transparency in the order summary, and a cart recovery deep link system that surfaces an actionable banner when users return after abandoning a registration.

### Feature 1: Proper 3 Payment Plan Types (Stage 3.2)
- Replaced generic "Monthly Payments" + "Bi-Weekly Payments" with the correct 3 plan types defined in the spec
- **Divided Payments**: N equal payments (default 3) spaced 2 weeks apart — schedule preview shown when selected
- **Two-Payment Split**: 50% due today, 50% at season midpoint with actual date label
- **Subscription Model**: Monthly recurring with 30-day cancellation notice, N months based on session length
- Each installment plan shows its full billing schedule when selected (expandable)
- `PlanType` union type (`'full' | 'divided' | 'subscription' | 'two_payment'`) replaces `'full' | 'monthly' | 'biweekly'`
- `PaymentFeeConfig` interface added for future org-configurable fees

### Feature 2: Payment Fees & Markup Transparency (Stage 3.2)
- `PaymentSummary.tsx` now renders registration fee and processing fee as separate line items (when configured via `PaymentFeeConfig`)
- Installment plans show per-payment schedule below the total — each payment date and amount listed
- `PaymentSummary` accepts `feeConfig` and `sessionStartDate` props and calls `calculatePaymentPlans` to derive actual due amounts
- Fee waiver for pay-in-full (configurable via `payInFullFeeWaived` flag)
- All amounts derived from single source of truth in `paymentPlans.ts` — no duplication

### Feature 3: Cart Recovery Deep Links (Stage 3.4)
- New `useCartRecovery` hook reads/writes cart state to localStorage with 24-hour TTL
- `saveCartRecovery()` / `clearCartRecovery()` / `readCartRecovery()` utilities exported for use anywhere
- `useCartAbandonment` hook now automatically syncs recovery data to localStorage on every cart change
- `markRecovered()` calls `clearCartRecovery()` so the banner disappears after completing registration
- New `CartRecoveryBanner` component: desktop top bar + mobile sticky bottom sheet
  - Shows child name, program name, amount, and which step was abandoned
  - "Continue" deep-links directly to `/register?token=<token>`
  - Dismiss button removes the localStorage entry
- `Home.tsx` updated to render `CartRecoveryBanner` when recovery data exists

**Files Changed:**
- `src/utils/paymentPlans.ts` — full rewrite with 3 plan types, `PaymentFeeConfig`, billing schedules
- `src/components/registration/PaymentPlanSelector.tsx` — updated for new `PlanType`, schedule preview, fee labels
- `src/components/registration/PaymentForm.tsx` — updated to `PlanType`, passes `sessionStartDate` + `feeConfig`
- `src/components/registration/PaymentSummary.tsx` — fee line items, installment schedule, `feeConfig` prop
- `src/pages/Register.tsx` — updated `PlanType` import, typed `setPaymentPlan` state
- `src/hooks/useCartAbandonment.ts` — localStorage sync via `saveCartRecovery`/`clearCartRecovery`
- `src/hooks/useCartRecovery.ts` — **NEW** — localStorage-based cart recovery hook + utilities
- `src/components/registration/CartRecoveryBanner.tsx` — **NEW** — dual-mode recovery banner component
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` — `useCartRecovery` integration + `CartRecoveryBanner` render

**No new DB migrations** — all changes are frontend/utility layer.

## [March 13, 2026] - Payment Psychology, Sibling Discounts & Re-enrollment | Core Feature | High

**Category:** Core Feature
**Impact:** High — Addresses 3 critical Stage 3 items (3.3, 3.5, 3.6)

**Description:**
Three Stage 3 features implemented to improve payment UX, sibling discount accuracy, and returning family experience.

### Feature 1: Payment Display Psychology (Stage 3.3)
- Added per-class cost display: "$26/class for 9 weeks" shown below total in Order Summary
- Updated "86% of families pay in full" text to styled "Most families pay in full" chip in PaymentPlanSelector
- `PaymentSummary.tsx` now accepts `sessionWeeks` prop and calculates per-class cost
- `PaymentForm.tsx` passes `sessionWeeks` to `PaymentSummary`

### Feature 2: Sibling Discount Auto-Detection Enhancement (Stage 3.5)
- Updated sibling discount from 10% → **25%** to match NBC Sports Engine benchmark ($50–60 savings on $200–250 programs)
- `Register.tsx` now performs debounced email lookup when parent enters their email
- If existing family found: pre-fills parent name and phone, shows "Welcome back!" banner with 5% returning family discount
- If family has active registrations: shows green "Sibling discount applied!" banner with 25% savings
- `hasOtherRegistrations` and `isReturningFamily` states properly passed to `PaymentForm` (were hardcoded `false`)
- Returning families reuse existing `family_id` instead of creating duplicate records

### Feature 3: Re-enrollment Flow (Stage 3.6)
- `RegistrationConfirmation.tsx` accepts new `onAddAnotherChild?: () => void` prop
- When `onAddAnotherChild` is provided, shows "Register another child? Save 25% with sibling discount" CTA card
- `Register.tsx` passes `onAddAnotherChild` handler routing back to home/chat
- Family record reuse in `createFamilyAndChild()` — returning families skip duplicate family creation
- `handleDemoPayment` also updated to reuse existing family ID

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/registration/PaymentSummary.tsx` — per-class cost display, `sessionWeeks` prop
- `src/components/registration/PaymentPlanSelector.tsx` — "Most families pay in full" styled chip
- `src/components/registration/PaymentForm.tsx` — passes `sessionWeeks` to PaymentSummary
- `src/components/registration/RegistrationConfirmation.tsx` — `onAddAnotherChild` prop + sibling CTA
- `src/utils/discountCalculator.ts` — sibling discount 10% → 25%
- `src/pages/Register.tsx` — email lookup, returning family detection, pre-fill, banner UI, family reuse

**No new DB migrations** — all changes are frontend/utility layer.
